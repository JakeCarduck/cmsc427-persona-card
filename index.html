                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A clear, separate section for 'Local Staff & Constitutent
                        Services' with direct emails and areas of focus.
                    </li>
                    <li>A public calendar of representatives' in-district events
                        (i.e., town halls, office hours, community coffees).
                    </li>
                    <li>Up-to-date info that avoids being pushing (such as trying
                        to get donations for a campaign).
                    </li>

                <h3>Frustrations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Figuring out which level of government is responsible for what;
                        in other words, who do I need to visit to solve my particular
                        problem?<br>
                        "The tools help you find who, but not which who for your specific
                        problem."
                    </li>
                    <li>Information overload and irrelevance.<br>
                        "Getting a list of 10 officials when I only need the one on the
                        county health board. It can be paralyzing and make you give up."
                    </li>
                    <li>Information is mixed together, making it hard to find the
                        specific sections for the actual representatives vs. their
                        public relations staff.<br>
                        "Why? Because that's how you actually build a relationship
                        and get practical things done."
